# for translators. Ignore this line. The changes made to the documentation (the main readme.md) will be write here. Use this file to update the documentation for your destination language. Each new change will be write at the end of the file. So, you just need to find the latest translated paragraph. If a text were deleted, the word "deleted" will be written at the begin of the line.

## start of the documentation changes (ignore this line).

For the documentation, I created a file called ["docChangelog-for-translators.md".](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidacm/NVDA-IBMTTS-Driver/master/docChangelog-for-translators.md)
you can use that file to see what has been changed in the documentation and update the documentation for your language.

3. If you want to translate the documentation too, you can see the new changes of the documentation
[at this link.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidacm/NVDA-IBMTTS-Driver/master/docChangelog-for-translators.md) You can see the [full english documentation here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidacm/NVDA-IBMTTS-Driver/master/readme.md)
